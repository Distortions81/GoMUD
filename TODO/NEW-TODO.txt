Consider use of maps vs lists for different apps
Consider async for most things
Where maps are kept, make sure we use a lock if we can write and read concurrently.
Possibly make functions to handle locking automatically,
or maybe just lock maps during game tick and during edit/write
make diagram of current code layout.
consider unique fingerprint for sector IDs, so importing sectors is easy.
have a local (dynamic) sector id/name alias for easy editing/viewing
sanitize player names, and file paths for security (path jail?)
telent negotiation.
