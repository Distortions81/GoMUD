Dream list

world->areas->sectors aka 1.1.10
aka north link 5-10
all sectors get unique ids, meaning they can be moved between areas, and we don't need to to put the area in the vnum.
fixes all worry of vnum juggling
areas/sectors/rooms show edit history, changes and builders.
areas on git for version history, with test/public branches

login->server->character
possibly make seperate program, that passes connections to servers (easier to handle copyover/crashes, and avoid reconnect/relog)

races/classes/skills/spells/commands scripting language, lower barrier to entry.
probably handle disconnected/deleted players/items/states at all times (via dedicated functions)

online quest editor



exits:
any word, enter/exit, custom enter/exit/action messages.


player aliases:
aliases := map[string]string

aliases[shortcutName] = output

ANSI color
make a connect list, track number of connections
max connections/minute per ip, autoban
ip/dns banning

with timestamps
logfile
chat log
input log --skip password

Check/Handle Character deallocation


olc editor layout

olc <prompts for edit type>
olc done <exits>

olc sector
olc room
olc object
olc trigger
olc mobile
olc quest

List commands should also allow search results
olc list areas (rename area in all matching sectors)
olc list sectors
olc list rooms
olc list objects
olc list mobiles
olc list triggers <room/sector>
olc list quests <room/sector/world>

needs description editor, for multi-line descriptons. Code can be re-used for notes and helps.

Could feasably bypass interp for ease of use, with do <command> to bypass. As well as add/delete line mode.


inside editors: blank line or command refreshes editor view
olc edit <field> (editor mode)
olc edit <field> <argument>
olc delete (prompts olc delete confirm, if set)

Edit modes should show any related triggers, objects, mobiles, etc... Auto-space vnums by 100?
move vnum command, fixes all links.


Need to save edit-mode and selection into player,
if we are in edit mode, any incomplete data.

Selections would be sector/vnum
and exit, trigger number,
