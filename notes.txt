Dream list

world->areas->sectors aka 1.1.10
aka north link 5-10
all sectors get unique ids, meaning they can be moved between areas, and we don't need to to put the area in the vnum.
fixes all worry of vnum juggling
areas/sectors/rooms show edit history, changes and builders.
areas on git for version history, with test/public branches

login->server->character
possibly make seperate program, that passes connections to servers (easier to handle copyover/crashes, and avoid reconnect/relog)

races/classes/skills/spells/commands scripting language, lower barrier to entry.
probably handle disconnected/deleted players/items/states at all times (via dedicated functions)

online quest editor
