possibly make seperate program, that passes connections to servers (easier to handle copyover/crashes, and avoid reconnect/relog)

races/classes/skills/spells/commands scripting language, lower barrier to entry.
probably handle disconnected/deleted players/items/states at all times (via dedicated functions)

-- OLE STUFF --
OLE editor layout

OLE <prompts for edit type>
OLE done <exits>

OLE sector
OLE room
OLE object
OLE trigger
OLE mobile
OLE quest

sub edits:
name
description
exit(rooms)
trigger(rooms)
flags
type(trigger/object)

List commands should also allow search results
OLE list areas (rename area in all matching sectors)
OLE list sectors
OLE list rooms
OLE list objects
OLE list mobiles
OLE list triggers <room/sector>
OLE list quests <room/sector/world>

needs description editor, for multi-line descriptons. Code can be re-used for notes and helps.
Could feasably bypass interp for ease of use, with do <command> to bypass. As well as add/delete line mode.
also allow ;; or \n, some kind of delim for single-line

inside editors: blank line or command refreshes editor view
OLE edit <field> (editor mode)
OLE edit <field> <argument>
OLE delete (prompts OLE delete confirm, if set)

Edit modes should show any related triggers, objects, mobiles, etc... Auto-space vnums by 100?
move vnum command, fixes all links.

heh, wierd idea.
for input or output... a find/replace filter players can make themselves.
or censor words or phrases
filter out add goodbye:au revoir
filter out add {k:{K (brighten black text to dark gray)
filter in add {2:{g convert old number-colors for letter colors
