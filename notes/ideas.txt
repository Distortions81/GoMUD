possibly make seperate program, that passes connections to servers (easier to handle copyover/crashes, and avoid reconnect/relog)

races/classes/skills/spells/commands scripting language, lower barrier to entry.
probably handle disconnected/deleted players/items/states at all times (via dedicated functions)

-- OLC STUFF --
OLC editor layout

OLC <prompts for edit type>
OLC done <exits>

OLC sector
OLC room
OLC object
OLC trigger
OLC mobile
OLC quest

sub edits:
name
description
exit(rooms)
trigger(rooms)
flags
type(trigger/object)

List commands should also allow search results
OLC list areas (rename area in all matching sectors)
OLC list sectors
OLC list rooms
OLC list objects
OLC list mobiles
OLC list triggers <room/sector>
OLC list quests <room/sector/world>

needs description editor, for multi-line descriptons. Code can be re-used for notes and helps.
Could feasably bypass interp for ease of use, with do <command> to bypass. As well as add/delete line mode.
also allow ;; or \n, some kind of delim for single-line

inside editors: blank line or command refreshes editor view
OLC edit <field> (editor mode)
OLC edit <field> <argument>
OLC delete (prompts OLC delete confirm, if set)

Edit modes should show any related triggers, objects, mobiles, etc... Auto-space vnums by 100?
move vnum command, fixes all links.
